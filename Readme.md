Yet Another Framework for "evolvable" web apps.

Provides structure and communication abstractions.
It helps answer 2 questions:

1. "How do I build UI components?"
2. "How do I make those components communicate in a sane way?"

## Nota bene!
The framework is intended to be "library-independent".

This project contains only basic abstractions and conventions.

You can find **usable implementation** of those abstractions built on top of AngularJS in [yaf-angular project](https://github.com/mr-mig/yaf-angular)

The idea is based on [organicjs](https://github.com/organicjs/organicjs) abstractions.
This is a playground for making those abstractions better by trying them on real use cases.

This is a Work-In-Progress implementation, **API will change often and unpredictably**.
